- Perform **Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP)** interpretation to determine the impact of attributes by their SHAP values and their interaction.
- Implemented **Light Gradient Boosting Model** algorithm to predict house's price with 17 numeric attributes inputs.
- *Technology*: Python, shap, lightgbm, optuna, numpy, pandas, streamlit, Google Colab, GitHub.

Ask a customer to describe their dream house, and they probably wonâ€™t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. Different customers will have different preference but generally, **what are the most important features to cost a house**? With 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa given in [/dataset/train.csv](/dataset/train.csv) this projects helps you predict the final price of each home.

### Milestone 1: [link](/milestone-1)

    Set up development environment

### Milestone 2: [link](/milestone-2)

    Perform the SHAP interpretation of the house price prediction using Linear Regression model

### Milestone 3: [link](/milestone-3)

    Repeat Milestone 2 but with Optuna and LightGBM model, then build a website by streamlit

### Milestone 4: [link](/milestone-4)

    DEMO TIME !
